Hi Fred,

I Really appreciate you stepping up to test this Tinkerers attempt to make DCC-EX & EXRAIL a Quick and Easy Fun Project.
This runs Really Well on a Mega with v4.1.1.

The memory issues are with the PORTX_HAL-cursense v4.2.4 branch with all the Extra ESP32, SAMD processor coding that's embedded in the code now.

Simple install.
Just Unzip the attached file and start with the first ReadMe.txt file and see if it makes sense for the general public Tinkerer.

I'm Too close to the project and I'm sure I've made it too repetitive and very Verbose.

Thanks Again
Kevin
